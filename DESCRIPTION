Description: Calculate weighted correlations of four types, Pearson, Spearman,
    Polychoric, and Polyserial. The Polychoric and Polyserial correlations are
    calculated numerically and can use either the well known fast method that
    approximates the nusiance parameters but does not optimize over them or
    a full ML estimation that typically gives almost identical results after
    multiplicatively longer run times. All correlations are dispatched by the
    'weightedCorr' function.
